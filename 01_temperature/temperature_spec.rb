# TIP: Always, ALWAYS read through all of the tests before you even start writing any code.

# Again, a file with a specific name needs to be created, in this case "temperature.rb".

# Now maybe we can talk more about the lines we ignored last problem.
# describe is a method that takes a sting and a do-end block.
# The method is given to use by RSpec.
# The string should describe what is being tested in the do-end block.

# Remember the difference between integers and floats:
# 1/2 equals 0
# but 1.0/2.0 equals 0.5
# It is important to know this difference to get these tests to pass.

# Also, you can use the following information to figure out what the equation 
# is to convert between the two units, fahrenheit and celsius: 
# 
# 1. One degree fahrenheit is 5/9 of one degree celsius
# 2. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees celsius but 32 degrees fahrenheit
