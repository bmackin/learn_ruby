      # Let's look at this snippet of code in particular:
      # 
      # reverser do 
      #   "hello"
      # end
      #
      # reverser is still a method, and it should return the reverse of the given string, i.e. "olleh",
      # except the string is not being passed in as a parameter. It's being passed in as a do-end block.
      # The way this method can get that do-end block is through yield.
      #
      # def example 
      #   string = yield # yield is equal to... 
      #   string.upcase
      # end
      # 
      # example do 
      #   "My name is Will Richman." # ...this line
      # end
      # 
      # So to get this test to pass the reverser method would look like:
      # 
      # def reverser
      #   yield.reverse
      # end
    end

    it "reverses each word in the string returned by the default block" do
